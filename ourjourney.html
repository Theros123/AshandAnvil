			<p class="content">Short guys struggle to to find clothes that fit well. We have two options: shop online hoping to find the right fit or go to a tailor. Our shopping experience is limited, time-consuming, and expensive.</p>

			<p>Throughout my adult life, I have experienced this dilemma first-hand. Off the rack  clothes never fit quite right. I have had to tailor too many pairs of paints and have rarely been lucky enough to find a shirt that doesn't fall to my knees. While my taller friends could find affordable new clothes in minutes, it often took me hours and cost significantly to get them tailored.</p>
			<p>Ash &amp; Anvil is creating clothes to fill this need and gap in men's clothing. We’re committed to bringing all shorter guys the perfect everyday clothes. While we’re starting with shirts, our collection will eventually feature all wardrobe staples. Our shirts are designed with our audience in mind, sporting a shorter length, shorter sleeves, narrow collars, and an overall fit that is more flattering.</p>
			<p>We value your feedback! Sign up for your newsletter, and we'll let you know when our first line of shirts is launched!</p>

			<h5 class="leading-content">Short men face an uphill battle when attempting to find clothing that fits their unique height and size. There are some options for men such as big and tall clothing stores, but none that focus on guys 5 foot 8 inches and shorter. Shopping for clothes is like gambling, every brand has a different length and cut. The best that shorter guys can hope for is to find a specific item for a brand that fits them well.</p>

			<h5>An underserved clothing niche</h5>
			<p>With 25% of all men in the U.S. 5 feet 8 inches and below, one might wonder where are the brands catering to this niche? We’ve already talked about big and tall stores. Women have petite brands as well as plus sized ones.</p>
			<p>For men, buying all clothing, including pants, shirts, jeans, etc., is difficult. Off-the-rack items may fit size wise, but will probably be way too long. The problem of the typical “small, medium, large, x-large” sizing, is that evertyhing scales up width and length together. No guy wants to look ridiculous with arm-sail sleeves and baggy pants.</p>

			<h5>The lack of good solutions</h5>
			<p>At Ash &amp; Anvil, we are acutely aware of the fact that there just aren’t many good solutions for shorter guys. Steven has struggled to find clothing that fits his entire adult life, having to resort to getting almost everything altered by a tailor. Here’s a few ways that we’ve found that might work for shorter guys to find clothing that fits:</p>

			<p><i>1. Buy custom-made or tailored clothing only</i></p>
			<p>An expensive option, but custom clothes should fit the best. However, most guys can’t and shouldn’t spend typically above $100 per item. Even altering off-the-rack clothes can add up at $15+ per item. It is difficult often times to find a tailor who can be trusted. Haven't we all had that really bad dry cleaning experience where your shirts came out ruined?</p>

			<p><i>2. Try your luck in a store or online</i></p>
			<p>You might have better luck finding what will fit on the Internet. However, as we touched on before, every brand has a different style and fit. The issue is that shorter guys have to try on everything to make sure the clothing actually fits. There are few options out there. Ash &amp; Anvil is fulfilling this niche starting with our casual button downs.</p>

			<h5>Ash &amp; Anvil - Everyday clothes for shorter guys</h5>
			<p>However, unlike most of these niche brands that focus on specific styles, Ash &amp; Anvil is building casual, everyday clothes for all shorter guys. We believe all guys should have clothes that fit well and make them look great. Sign up for our newsletter and stay tuned as Ash &amp; Anvil changes the struggle that shorter guys have when buying clothes.</p>

			<h5 class="leading-content">If you are 5 feet 8 inches or shorter, dressing well is very important. Shorter guys have wiggle room in the clothing options they have available to them. Most items will not fit off-the-rack at all. Read on for some helpful tips to follow to always look your best.</p>

			<h5>General tips to look good</h5>
			<p>As a shorter man, you have faced problems finding the right fitting clothes. However, don’t be fooled by expensive clothes or brands that promise to make you appear taller. Those are just marketing gimmicks. Take the time to learn your body type, and what looks good on you. While it isn’t rocket science, finding the specific items from each brand that fits best takes a lot of work.</p>

			<p>Here are a few simple rules that will help you to dress for success and help you to feel good about yourself, while boost your self-confidence to no end!</p>
			
			<p>Avoid bold stripes, both horizontal and vertical. Go for rich materials that fall gracefully and add stature just by their rich looks and feel, like silk and linen and rich cotton. Such materials will automatically help you to feel like a million bucks, by their feel, fit and comfort.</p>

			<p>Go for fine checks, or delicately self-patterned materials. This will help to make your shirts look interesting without being boring or loud. This is especially necessary if you have a paunch or a beer belly. Such self-patterns can help to camouflage problem areas.</p>

			<h5>For formal clothes</h5>
			<p>For formal trousers and other pants, pay attention to the fit around the seat and the thigh areas. For inseams and lengths, you can always get them altered much easier compared to measurements like waist. If you have a weird body type, EX skinny legs and a beer gut, getting altered or custom clothes might be your only option.</p>

			<p>Many short men also tend to have shorter arms and legs; this means that anything ready-to-wear might pose problems with fitting. Most clothing isn’t designed for people below the average of 5 feet 9 inches. The best thing to do if you have less than average length in your arms and legs, is to go for bespoke tailoring. However, bespoke tailoring is unfortunately an option open to only a select few - the (in)famous 1% of the population! The rest of us have to try and find the best fitting clothes from the ready-to-wear market.</p>

			<p>The same basic rules of thumb applies to more formal clothing. No bold stripes or checks. Stick to fine stripes, checks or plain suits. If you are top heavy, then wearing the right fitting clothes becomes all the more important. A bad-fitting suit will make you look boxy. Stick to single breasted suits, with just one or two buttons – this will help to create the illusion of height.</p>

			<p>A custom tailored suit in a good material with the right accessories can make you look your best, and boost your confidence levels. However, since custom tailoring is prohibitively expensive and not available to the average guy, it is not a viable option for most of us. For the rest of us, we’ll need to shop around and find the right brand and fit to suit our body types, and stick to it.</p>

			<p>If you’re opting for the custom tailoring, be aware that there might be an initial wait of four to eight weeks, with need for alterations in the beginning.</p>

			<h5>For casual clothes</h5>
			<p>Casual wear might present an issue as well. Most shorts, t-shirts, and jeans are designed for the average person. As a shorter guy, you will have a problem with the casual wear too, leading to frustration. Unlike the formal wear, there is no option to have them custom-made. Even if you’re ready to spend the megabucks to go for custom-made clothes, you can’t do that with casual wear. Once you find a brand or style that fits you around the seat and thigh areas for trousers, buy them, and go for alterations in any other areas, when necessary.</p>

			<p>For casual tees and polos too, the same rule applies. Find a brand that fits your shoulder and arms. You can always have it altered to take in material around the middle if necessary. You just need to shop around and try different brands and sizes until you find the one that fits you the best, and keep buying from them so that you can be sure that whatever you buy will fit.</p>

			<h5>For outerwear and jackets</h5>
			<p>Weather appropriate clothing can also be hard to find for shorter guys. Though many clothing and accessories manufacturers offer smaller sizes in women’s clothing, men’s clothing are still hard to find in smaller sizes. Always go for shorter jackets or cropped jackets, so that your legs will appear longer. If you’re a short guy wearing a typical jacket, you’ll be drowning with fabric below your knees, however well-made and whatever brand it might be.</p>

			<h5>Accessories</h5>
			<p>Be sure to keep your accessories too to scale – a thin belt and a slim tie, so that your middle area doesn’t look bulky. A wider belt or a broader tie might just highlight your problem areas, taking away from your looks, and making you appear shorter or wider.</p>

			<h5>To sum up, sweat the details!</h5>
			<p>Pay attention to fit and find the specific brands that work for you! The color, material and pattern all come later. It is the fit that is the fundamental principle to the well-dressed man. Avoiding bold prints, checks, and stripes is the next step for the better dressed man. You don’t need to spend a fortune to be dressed right. All you need is to be aware of how to dress your best highlighting your phsyical attributes. If you can do that, you’re all set to go out and wow people. A little bit of power dressing can go a long way, both personally and professionally, for men!</p>

			</div>
			<p>Pele is five feet eight inches tall. Pele is considered to be the best soccer player that has ever lived. Possibly the athlete of the twentieth century by popular and sports writer’s votes.</p>
			<p>Pele put soccer on the world map in the Olympics and in the World Cup. Soccer in South America and the United States will always be inspired by this shorter athlete that knew more about performance and skill than any other player. Pele continues to be in the limelight constantly promoting soccer, being named as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, and even being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

			<h5>Bruce Lee - Martial Arts Master</h5>

			</div>
			<p>Standing 5 feet 8 inches tall, Bruce Lee made martial arts a worldwide phenomena. Lee started his career in China at an early age and was acknowledged champion of many martial arts forms. Moving to the United States at an early age, Lee is best known and remembered for his martial arts movies.</p>
			<p>Kung Fu movies has been a favorite of Hong Kong cinema, but Lee brought martial arts to a world audience with legendary movies like Enter the Dragon. No person has ever demonstrated the variety of skills or the level of technique that Lee displayed in his movies. Lee did all of his own stunts and was frequently injured.</p>
			<p>Despite being a shorter guy, Bruce Lee’s legendary status and legacy is forever cemented in his movies and blood curdling fighting screams.</p>

			<h5>Henri Richard - Determined Hockey Player</h5>

			<p>At 5 feet 7 inches in height, Henri Richard is considered to have been the best hockey player that ever lived. Richard was instrumental in winning more Stanley cups and played in more consecutive games than any hockey pro.</p>
			<p>While hockey is considered one of the most brutal and dangerous contact sports, Richard beat out opponents that outweighed him by 50 pounds, and over six inches taller than him, with finesse, skill, and guts.</p>
			<p>Richard knew how to win fans approval and often used his superior skills to make dazzling last minute goals. He is credited with being one of the most influential players that made hockey an international major sport.</p>

			<p>At 5 feet 7 inches tall, Spud Webb is a national dunk champion. Webb played in college at North Carolina and was drafted into the pros, only playing one quarter per game for his first four years.</p>
			<p>When Webb got his shot to really play, he not only beat out a player six inches taller than himself for the dunk championship, but also became one of the leading scorers. He played more than two quarters in every game for twelve years, gave more assists than any other player, and could always be counted on for at least one steal. Even today’s taller players cannot match Webb’s ability and skill.</p>
